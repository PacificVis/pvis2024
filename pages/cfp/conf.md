Submissions are invited to the new Conference Paper Track at IEEE PacificVis 2024. Papers demonstrating high quality in terms of originality, rigor, and significance will be published in the IEEE PacificVis conference proceedings. Both new submissions and papers rejected from the TVCG journal track are invited to be submitted to the Conference Paper track. 

Unlike in previous years, rejected papers from the TVCG journal track are not automatically forwarded to the Conference Paper track. However, the deadlines for the TVCG and conference paper tracks are explicitly organized so that a paper rejected to the TVCG journal paper track can optionally be revised and resubmitted to the conference paper track (if the authors so desire). During the resubmission process, the authors can choose to maintain reviewer continuity (with at least one reviewer and the full reviews from the TVCG journal track available and by uploading a revision letter) or have the paper be treated like a new submission. We encourage authors of rejected papers to take advantage of this mechanism.

Following the initial notification of review results, conditionally accepted papers (including supplemental material) will undergo a revision and review cycle in order to ensure that they are acceptable for publication and presentation in the conference proceedings. The paper and its supplemental material will also be submitted to the IEEE Digital Library, in accordance with its standard terms and conditions.
