Submissions are invited to the new IEEE TVCG Journal Paper Track at IEEE PacificVis 2024. Papers demonstrating exceptional quality in terms of originality, rigor, and significance will be published in a special issue of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). The acceptance rate is anticipated to be around 22%-25%, depending on the decisions from the review process. Following the initial notification of review results, conditionally accepted papers (including supplemental material) will undergo a revision and review cycle in order to ensure that they are acceptable for publication and presentation in TVCG. The paper and its supplemental material will also be submitted to the IEEE Digital Library in accordance with its standard terms and conditions.

Note that the deadlines for the journal and conference paper tracks are explicitly organized so that a paper rejected to the TVCG journal paper track can optionally be revised and resubmitted to the conference paper track (if the authors so desire). During the resubmission process, the authors can choose to maintain reviewer continuity (with at least one reviewer and the full reviews from the TVCG journal track available) or have the paper be treated like a new submission. We encourage authors of rejected papers to take advantage of this mechanism.
