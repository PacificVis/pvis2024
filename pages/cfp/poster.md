The PacificVis 2024 Poster Program welcomes all areas of visualization research, including information visualization, scientific visualization, and visual analytics science and technology. As we would like the authors to demonstrate novel and applicable ideas in all aspects of visualization, posters on work in progress and practical applications are welcome.

An interactive poster session will be held to allow plenty of opportunities for one-on-one dialogue and small group discussion in a casual setting. The two-page summary of the accepted posters will be included in the electronic conference proceedings.

# Submission

Original, unpublished posters of up to 2 pages (figures, tables, and references included) are invited.  Manuscripts should be prepared according to the guide for authors given at [`https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/`](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/).

The work should encompass a concise description of the background, problem statement, research objectives and methodology, main findings, supporting tables or graphs, and a discussion of the implications of the work. While comprehensive literature searches are not expected, the inclusion of key and relevant citations is required.


# Selection Process

Submissions undergo a juried selection process, offering lighter feedback without author responses or conditional acceptances, and not necessitating the same level of contribution as refereed content. Posters are subject to a single-blind review by co-chairs, primarily evaluating abstracts and considering additional materials when available.
