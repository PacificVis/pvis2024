IEEE PacificVis 2024 solicits novel research contributions and innovative applications in all areas of visualization. PacificVis is a unified visualization symposium covering topics such as information visualization, scientific visualization, visual analytics, and visualization applications in domains such as (but not limited to) biological sciences, education, machine learning, physical sciences, security, and social science.

IEEE PacificVis 2024 will be held in Tokyo, Japan on April 23-26, 2024. The symposium accepts a range of scientific contributions ranging from full research papers, short papers, and posters. This year, PacificVis has a TVCG journal paper track, a conference full paper track, and a short paper (VisNotes) track with consecutive deadlines. These tracks have separate calls for papers:

- Call for papers - [TVCG journal papers](/pvis2024/cfp/journal/)
- Call for papers - [conference papers](/pvis2024/cfp/conf/)
- Call for papers - [short papers (VisNotes)](/pvis2024/cfp/note/)

The deadlines for the tracks are arranged so that papers rejected from an earlier track can be resubmitted to a following track (with optional reviewer continuity). All submitted papers will go through a two-stage review process to guarantee the publication of high-quality papers. Accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference and will also be published by IEEE and included in the [IEEE Digital Library](https://www.ieee.org/publications/subscriptions/products/mdl/ieeexplore-access.html). Papers accepted in the journal track will be published directly in [IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=2945).

# Paper Type and Topics

See the separate document on [paper types and topics](/pvis2024/cfp/types/) of interest for IEEE PacificVis.


# Submission Guidelines

When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to the [paper submission guidelines](/pvis2024/cfp/guidelines/).


# Reviewing Process and Review Criteria

IEEE PacificVis papers undergo a rigorous review process over multiple rounds of reviewing (VisNotes have a slightly shorter review process). Some papers may be desk rejected—rejected before they enter this detailed peer reviewing—by the papers chairs if they determine that the submission is clearly out of scope for the conference, is written using poor language that precludes effective communication, does not follow the formatting guidelines, or is otherwise not appropriate.

Decisions after the first round of reviews are usually conditional acceptances or rejections. All conditionally accepted papers come with written requirements for final acceptance. Effectively addressing these requirements in a second round version of the paper is essential and the responsibility of the authors. Reviewers may sometimes communicate directly with authors to address minor points in the revised paper, effectively allowing for additional reviewing rounds. However, such additional communication is at the discretion of reviewers and not a requirement. If the revised version of a paper fails to address feedback to the satisfaction of the reviewers, the paper will ultimately be rejected after the second reviewing round.
