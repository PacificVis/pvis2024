# Design Guidelines and Human-AI Collaboration for Data Storytelling<br/><small>Prof. Huamin Qu<br/>Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</small> {#huamin_qu}
*Chair: Issei Fujishiro*

Date
: 9:30-10:30, April 24

Abstract
: Data storytelling involves crafting a compelling story around data, using a combination of visualizations, text, and multimedia elements to convey a message that resonates with the audience. In this keynote, we will present our research on data storytelling, focusing on guidelines for crafting effective openings and endings in data videos, using Freytag's Pyramid to create structured data stories, and exploring the potential of human-AI collaboration in data storytelling. We will share insights on creating effective data-GIFs and provide suggestions for improving their understandability. Drawing on cinematic arts, we will present guidelines for creating cinematic openings and endings in data videos. Finally, we will discuss the potential of AI to support humans in data storytelling and identify research opportunities for human-AI collaboration in this field.

# Human-Data Interaction: Data Visualization and Beyond<br/><small>Prof. Bongshin Lee<br/>Yonsei University</small> {#bongshin_lee}
*Chair: Kwan-Liu Ma*

Date
: 09:00-10:00, April 26

Abstract
: Data plays a pivotal role in our daily lives, offering vast possibilities to shape our work, lifestyles, and interactions with the world. Over the last few decades, data visualization has proven to be a powerful tool for gaining and communicating insights, as well as facilitating informed decision-making in diverse fields and contexts. However, visualization research has traditionally centered on narrow aspects of how people interact with data. Much of the research has focused on desktop environments designed for data experts and individuals without disabilities, overlooking the diverse human capabilities and needs. In this talk, I advocate for expanding the scope of our research endeavors to cover a wider range of activities and contexts in which individuals interact with data, aiming to serve a more diverse audience. I will illustrate how my research has evolved from concentrated efforts in data visualization to a broader exploration in human-data interaction. I will present recent projects on novel and inclusive data interaction experiences that leverage advancements in input technologies and AI. I will also suggest exciting research avenues we can pursue to enrich data interaction experiences, going beyond data visualization, for a wider audience, which will also help to make data and data visualization accessible and beneficial to everyone.
