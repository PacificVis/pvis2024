## 1-1	Visual Analysis of Leading Lines in Artworks Based on Discrete Morse Theory and Evaluation by Design Experts
Fuminori Shibasaki, Keio University

Abstract
: Accomplished artists often incorporate leading lines into their compositions to guide the observer’s attention. While saliency maps are typically employed to identify attractive regions in still images, such scalar features do not express the trajectory of an observer’s gaze. In our study, we propose a method for the visual analysis of leading lines based on discrete Morse theory applied to saliency maps. Furthermore, we conducted evaluation experiments with students and research assistants at an art university on Western paintings from the 17th to the 19th century to investigate the feasibility and limitations of our proposed approach.

## 1-2	Comparative 3D Visualization for Ocean Data Analysis Based on Mode Water Regions
Midori Yano, Ochanomizu University

Abstract
: With advances in data collection methods and calculation techniques, ocean data precision has become increasingly accurate. The proposed visual analysis enables to look for the features of each ocean data based on shape comparison of mode water regions that exist in the ocean using two approaches: visualization of view-based shape similarity, and image-based view selection in the virtual reality space. This talk introduces 3D visual comparisons of mode water regions with interactive exploration.

## 2-1 Network Visualization and Visual Decision Support Systems
Hyunwoo Park, Seoul National University

Abstract
: Businesses and organizations today collect and store unprecedented quantities of data. To make informed decisions with such a massive amount of data, organizations seek to utilize machine learning and AI techniques. Applying advanced techniques must be preceded by a careful examination of the raw data. However, human examination is prone to fail without adequate tools to describe large and complex data. Data visualization empowers human decision-makers to find patterns in such data in an effective manner. This talk presents my research on how interactive visualization helps explore network data and facilitates decision-making processes by demonstrating visual analytics applications.

## 2-2 Access to AI to Understand Human Behavior and Decision-making
Sangbong Yoo, Sejong University

Abstract
: AI started as a tool to replace simple human labor, but recently, AI research to mimic human thinking, such as Large Language Models, is attracting attention. However, for AI to mimic human thinking, it needs to understand human cognitive processes. A person's cognitive process uses organs such as eyes, nose, mouth, muscles, brain, etc. to gather information, understand, act, and make decisions until decision-making. Unlike humans, AI does not have organs, so to make decisions similar to humans using given information, it learns to obtain and utilize insights from data. This talk introduces visual analysis technologies and future researchers' challenges for analyzing data generated from humans to enable AI to understand human cognitive processes and simulate decision-making processes.

Abstract
: The lecture focused on the use of interactive web pages to build narrative visualization. It analyzes how to integrate front-end tools, data science and visual design to create dynamic and immersive narrative scenes, explains the whole process from data processing to information architecture and interaction design in detail, and reveals its unique advantages in guiding users to deep participation, insight into data connotation, and strengthening information cognition. Through the analysis of examples, the elaboration of design concepts and the prospect of application, the audience will be inspired to grasp the potential and value of this innovative design technique in various fields, and stimulate the enthusiasm for practice and exploration.

## 3-2 Deep Learning for Scientific Data Compression
Chongke Bi, Tianjin University

Abstract
: In the field of scientific research, thanks to the rapid development of supercomputer performance, domain experts are able to perform larger scale, higher precision, and faster iterative numerical simulation calculations, which provides valuable insights for understanding natural phenomena and scientific discoveries. However, due to the limitations of I/O speed and storage resources, the raw resolution data generated by large-scale numerical simulation calculations is difficult to efficiently transfer to storage media, and it is also difficult to manage storage. This has become the main bottleneck problem when processing large-scale scientific data in scientific visualization and visual analysis workflows. To overcome these problem, lossy compressors have become a key tool. In this talk, I will introduce our recent work for scientific data compression based on deep learning. We have designed several lossy compression methods based on super-resolution and implicit neural representation model. Because these two models can achieve excellent reconstruction quality and better compression ratio than traditional methods in data compression and reconstruction tasks. Finally, I will briefly discuss the future prospects of this dynamic research direction.
